# AlgoLink C++

## Requirements

- libjson0-dev
- libcurl4-gnutls-dev
- libboost-program-options-dev

libboost-program-options-dev is only necessary for compiling main.cpp. If only compiling algolink.cpp (libalgolink.a or embedding source into an application), it is not needed.

## Compile

$ make [libalgolink.a]

## Use

This will generate a libalgolink.a that can be used linked against. Or the code can be integrated into an existing application.

## Known Issues

None
